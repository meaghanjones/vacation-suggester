        <h1>Pack your bags <span class="name"></span>. You should go to: <br><span class="locationname"> Todos Santos, Baja, Mexico!</span></h1>
        <img class="displayed" src="img/todossantos.jpg">
        <p>Todos Santos is one of the most appealing towns in all of Baja, maybe even all of Mexico. A quirky mix of locals, fishers, surfers and New Age spiritualists, the town of ‘All Saints’ has thus far escaped the rampant tourism of the other Cape towns, but still has all kinds of things to see and do. Think Taos, New Mexico, before Ansel Adams and Georgia O’Keefe brought the world there. Be prepared for high prices, however.<br><br>
        Todos Santos’ newfound prosperity does not reflect its history. Founded in 1723, but nearly destroyed by the Pericú rebellion in 1734, Misión Santa Rosa de Todos los Santos limped along until its abandonment in 1840. In the late 19th century Todos Santos became a prosperous sugar town with several brick trapiches (mills), but depleted aquifers have nearly eliminated this thirsty industry. The crumbling, photo-worthy brick structures still remain in several parts of town.
        Like many other parts of Baja, Todos Santos is changing and local development is rampant. So come here now before it changes forever.

        <img class="displayed" src="img/preikestolen.jpg">
        <p>Preikestolen (English: Preacher's Pulpit or Pulpit Rock) is a famous tourist attraction in the municipality of Forsand in Rogaland county, Norway. Preikestolen is a steep cliff which rises 604 metres (1,982 ft) above the Lysefjorden. Atop the cliff, there is an almost flat top of approximately 25 by 25 meters (82 ft × 82 ft). It sits on the north side of the fjord, opposite the Kjerag plateau, located on the south side.<br><br>The cliff was formed during the ice age, approximately 10,000 years ago, when the edges of the glacier reached the cliff. The water from the glacier froze in the crevices of the mountain and eventually broke off large, angular blocks, which were later carried away with the glacier. This is the cause of the angular shape of the plateau. Along the plateau itself there continues to be a deep crack. Due to these cracks, the plateau will at some point fall down, but all the geological investigations have revealed that this will not happen in the foreseeable future, and geologists have confirmed the safety of the plateau.<br><br>The cliff overlooks the lush green valleys of the Ryfylke region. The mountains surrounding the cliff reach heights of up to 843 metres (2,766 ft). Some of the hilltops have plains which are interspersed with lakes.<a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/norway/preikestolen"> Read More Here!</a>

        <h1>Pack your bags <span class="name"></span>. You should go to: <br><span class="locationname"> Saint Moritz, Switzerland!</span></h1>
        <img class="displayed" src="img/stmoritz.jpg">
        <p>
        St. Moritz is more than just a holiday resort. It was also the birthplace of Alpine winter holidays (in 1864) and has twice hosted the Winter Olympics. Nevertheless, St. Moritz first became famous thanks to its mineral springs, which were discovered 3,000 years ago and established the town as a summer spa resort early on.<br><br>
        St. Moritz, which is in the Upper Engadine, at an elevation of 1,856 m, boasts plenty of sunny days. It was exactly this sun that was legally protected as the emblem of St. Moritz in 1930. St. Moritz was often ahead of the times - for example, the first electric light went on at Christmastime in 1878, the first golf tournament in the Alps took place here, in 1889 and one of the first ski lifts in Switzerland began running in 1935.<br><br>
        Guests from all over the world appreciate the modern Alpine lifestyle, characterised by top-class restaurants that can satisfy gourmet demands even by the side of the slopes, hotels that set standards in every category, and events of international calibre. The Via Serlas guarantees great shopping in a small space, though you can also find local specialities like the famous Engadine nut tart just around the corner.<a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/switzerland/graubunden/st-moritz"> Read More Here!</a>

        Machu Picchu is an Incan city surrounded by temples, terraces and water channels, built on a mountaintop. It was built with huge blocks of stone joined to each other without any mortar. Today it has been designated cultural heritage of humanity in recognition of its political, religious and administrative importance during the age of the Incas.
